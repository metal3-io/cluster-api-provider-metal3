# E2E testing

This doc gives short instructions how to run e2e tests. For the developing e2e tests, please refer to [Developing E2E tests](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/e2e.html).

To run e2e tests, you need to have [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)

After that, run e2e tests with

```sh
./scripts/ci-e2e.sh
```
