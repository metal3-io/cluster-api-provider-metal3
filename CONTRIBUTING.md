## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

## Finding Things That Need Help

If you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start, we
have a semi-curated list of issues that
should not need deep knowledge of the system. [Have a look and see if anything
sounds interesting](https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
Alternatively, read some of the docs on other controllers and try to write your
own, file and fix any/all issues that come up, including gaps in documentation!

## Contributing a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see
   details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

All code PR must be labeled with one of

- ‚ö†Ô∏è (:warning:, major or breaking changes)
- ‚ú® (:sparkles:, minor or feature additions)
- üêõ (:bug:, patch and bugfixes)
- üìñ (:book:, documentation or proposals)
- üå± (:seedling:, minor or other)

All changes must be code reviewed. Coding conventions and standards are
explained in the official [developer
docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel).
Expect reviewers to request that you
avoid common [go style
mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

## Backporting a Patch

Cluster API maintains older versions through `release-X.Y` branches. We accept
backports of bug fixes to the most recent
release branch. For example, if the most recent branch is `release-0.2`, and the
`main` branch is under active
development for v0.3.0, a bug fix that merged to `main` that also affects
`v0.2.x` may be considered for backporting
to `release-0.2`. We generally do not accept PRs against older release branches.

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are generally allowed in the `main` branch, as this is the
branch used to develop the next minor release of Cluster API.

There may be times, however, when `main` is closed for breaking changes. This
is likely to happen as we near the release of a new minor version.

Breaking changes are not allowed in release branches, as these represent minor
versions that have already been released.
These versions have consumers who expect the APIs, behaviors, etc. to remain
stable during the life time of the patch stream for the minor release.

Examples of breaking changes include:

- Removing or renaming a field in a CRD
- Removing or renaming a CRD
- Removing or renaming an exported constant, variable, type, or function
- Updating the version of critical libraries such as controller-runtime,
  client-go, apimachinery, etc.
- Some version updates may be acceptable, for picking up bug fixes, but
  maintainers must exercise caution when reviewing.

There may, at times, need to be exceptions where breaking changes are allowed in
release branches. These are at the discretion of the project's maintainers, and
must be carefully considered before merging. An example of an allowed
breaking change might be a fix for a behavioral bug that was released in an
initial minor version (such as `v0.3.0`).
